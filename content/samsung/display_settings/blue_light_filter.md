than other colors of light. However, as sun is so far away from away from us, the blue light in sunlight is not a concern. However, what is concerning is the blue light emitted from digital screens like smartphone, laptops, etc. As these devices are typically used really close to our eyes, longtime exposure to digital screen can cause eye strain, blurred vision, and headaches due to the emitted blue light. 

Blue light can also reduce the production of melatonin, the hormone responsible for making us sleepy. So, using smartphone for hours before going to sleep can make it difficult to fall asleep. Thankfully, most smartphones come with blue light filter these days. Enabling this feature will give the display a brownish tint and reduce the amount of emitted blue light.

On Samsung phones, to enable blue light filter, First, go to the Settings menu by either clicking on the gear icon or scrolling down on your home screen and clicking on the top right hand corner.

If you click on 'Sunset to sunrise', the phone will ask you for location permission because it needs to know when is sunrise and sunset at your current location. Click on 'While Using the app'. This will take you to a new page. You don't have to change anything here. Just click on the back button at the top left to go back.
