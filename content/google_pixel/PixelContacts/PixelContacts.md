#### Opening the phone app

When you think of a phone, you think of calling people or sending them messages. Unfortunately, it might be hard to remember everyone's phone number all the time. Thankfully, your Android phone has an option to save phone numbers to your contacts! First, open you App Drawer and find the Phone app.

#### Adding a contact

As you can see there is an empty speed dial screen, and some buttons on the bottom for your favorites, recents, contacts, and voicemail. Favorites are people who you marked as favorite when creating their contact. Recents will have all the people you called recently and all the people who called you. Contacts will have all the people you saved to your phone. Voicemail will allow you to listen to your voicemails. To make a new contact, open the phone pad using the phone pad button and type in the phone number.
