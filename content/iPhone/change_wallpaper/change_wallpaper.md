# Changing Wallpaper

Are you tired of seeing the same wallpaper every single day? Changing your wallpaper every few weeks can give your phone a fresh new look. Phones these days come with pretty good selection of wallpapers but also there are great apps on the app store that has a wide selection of wallpapers. You can change your phone's wallpaper in just a couple of steps. 

First, we need to go to the settings menu. To do this, keep on swiping to the right from the home screen and the last page you reach is the app library. The app library page will look like the image to the left. From here, search for 'Settings' in the top search bar and the settings app will come up in the result. Click on 'Settings'.

After opening settings, scroll down until you find 'Wallpaper' and click on it.

Here you will see your lock screen and home screen wallpaper. If you swipe to the left, you will see some preset wallpaper setups that come with the phone. If you like them, you can click on 'Set as Current' button to set that as your new wallpaper.

Now if you click on the icon in the left hand corner, you will see the option to enable or disable depth effect. Currently depth effect is 'On' and for that reason, the right edge of  '6' in time 9:36 is hidden under the wallpaper. If we turn depth effect off, the number will be over the wallpaper as seen in the image to the right.

Now, you can also click on the icon to the right hand corner to choose between light and dark mode version of the wallpaper. The left image below shows the dark mode version and the image to the right shows the light mode version.

Let's stick to the dark mode version. Now, click on the 'Add' button in the top right corner. This will show a popup where if you click on 'Set as Wallpaper Pair', then this will be set as both the home and lock screen wallpaper and you are done!

After clicking on 'Photo', we decide to select the image to the left as our home screen wallpaper. Now click on the blue 'Done' button in the top right hand corner. This will take you back to the previous page. Here, you can also enable the Blur option if you want to. For now, we will not blur our home screen wallpaper. So, let's click on the gray 'Done' button in the top right corner.
