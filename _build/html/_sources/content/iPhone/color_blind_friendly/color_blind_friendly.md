# Color Blind Friendly Mode

Colorblindness is more prevalent than people might think. There are approxiately 300 million colorblind people worldwide. [^1] To accomodate for these people, modern smartphones have color blind friendly mode that can boost the user experience for color-blind people.

First, we need to go to the settings menu. To do this, keep on swiping to the right from the home screen and the last page you reach is the app library. The app library page will look like the image to the left. From here, search for 'Settings' in the top search bar and the settings app will come up in the result. Click on 'Settings'.

After opening settings, scroll down until you find 'Accessibility' and click on it.

Now, you can click on the toggle beside 'Color Filters' to enable it. When it's enabled, it will turn green. Next, you can select different color palettes based on the different types of color blindness. Choose the one that's best for you. You can also move the intensity slider to fix how much color adjustment you want to be in effect.
