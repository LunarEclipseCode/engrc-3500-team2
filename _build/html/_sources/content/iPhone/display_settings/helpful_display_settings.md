* How to make using smartphones less straining on my eyes?

* Why is my fingerprint scanner not working properly after installing a screen protector?

Well, then this tutorial is for you! In this tutorial, we will go over some useful display settings on your smartphone that can make your user experience just a little better.

#### Switching Between Light and Dark Mode

First, we need to go to the settings menu. To do this, keep on swiping to the right from the home screen and the last page you reach is the app library. The app library page will look like the image to the left. From here, search for 'Settings' in the top search bar and the settings app will come up in the result. Click on 'Settings'.

#### Blue Light Filter

If you pass in sunlight through a prism, the light will be spread out into a rainbow. Here, we can see the presence of blue light in sunlight. Blue light contains more energy

than other colors of light. However, as sun is so far away from away from us, the blue light in sunlight is not a concern. However, what is concerning is the blue light emitted from digital screens like smartphone, laptops, etc. As these devices are typically used really close to our eyes, longtime exposure to digital screen can cause eye strain, blurred vision, and headaches due to the emitted blue light.

Blue light can also reduce the production of melatonin, the hormone responsible for making us sleepy.[^1] So, using smartphone for hours before going to sleep can make it difficult to fall asleep. Thankfully, most smartphones come with blue light filter these days. Enabling this feature will give the display a brownish tint and reduce the amount of emitted blue light.

On iPhones, to enable blue light filter, go to the 'Display and Brightness' section of settings by following the steps discussed in the 'Switching Between Light and Dark Mode' section. Now scroll down and you will see the 'Night Shift' option. Let's click on it.

Here you will see the option to enable blue light filter. You can also adjust how much brownish tint you want by adjusting the color temperature slider. 

#### Screen Timeout

Have you ever wondered:

* Why does my phone screen goes off as soon as I leave it on the table?

* Why does my phone screen stays on for a while if I just leave it unlocked?

If you have experienced either of those two problems, this part of the tutorial is for you! You can adjust the screen timeout period on your phone to set after how long the phone should lock itself if you accidentally leave the screen on.

To adjust this time, first go to the display 'Display and Brightness' section on your iPhone by following the first four images shown in the 'Switching Between Light and Dark Mode' section. Now scroll down on this page and you will see the 'Auto-Lock' option. Let's click on it.

Now you will see the different options you have for your screen timeout period. Click the one that you are most comfortable with.

That's it! Now you know about all the helpful display related settings on your phone. Feel free to explore the settings menu on your phone to discover more interesting features.
