# Remove Ads on Website

These days many websites are infested with advertisements. The following post from Andy Budd summarizes the best the current state of browsing the web:<img src="file:///D:/College/7th%20Semester/ENGRC%203500/group_project_update/engrc-3500-team2/content/samsung/try/web_experience.png" title="" alt="" data-align="center">

These ads not only reduces the web surfing experience, but also sometimes takes you to malicious sites if you accidentally click on it. You can block these annoying ads in websites very easily.

On your phone, go to the list of apps and click on 'Play Store'. In play store, you will see a search bar at top.

In the search bar, type in 'firefox' and click on the blue search icon on the keybaord (at the right most corner). Now click on 'Install'.

Now firefox will start downloading. Once the downloading and installation process is complete, the 'Install' button will turn into an 'Open' button. Click on 'Open'.

When you open firefox, it will ask some questions to help the setup process of the app. Just click on 'Not now' for all three of these questions. When you click on 'Not now' for one question, the app will automatically take you to the next question.

When you click on 'Not now' for the final question, it will take to the homepage of firefox. Also, the app will not ask you these questions again. It's just when you launch the app for the first time on your phone.

Now, click on the three dots at the top right corner, and then click on 'Add Ons'.
