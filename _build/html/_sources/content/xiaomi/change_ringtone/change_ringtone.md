After hearing some ringtones, we realized the 'Happy Bujiwuji Concert' is a pretty good ringtone. To change your current ringtone to this one, click on the bell icon that's to the right of the ringtone name. Now, you will see a popup asking whether you want to select the ringtone. Click 'OK'. The system will start downloading the ringtone and it will take a couple of seconds.
