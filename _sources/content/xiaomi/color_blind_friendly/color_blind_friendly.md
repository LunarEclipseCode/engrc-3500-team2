# Color Blind Friendly Mode

Colorblindness is more prevalent than people might think. There are approxiately 300 million colorblind people worldwide. [^1] To accomodate for these people, modern smartphones have color blind friendly mode that can boost the user experience for color-blind people.

First, go to the Settings menu by either clicking on the gear icon or scrolling down on your home screen and clicking on the top right hand corner.
