# Software Update

There are basically two forms of update in a smartphone. You can update your installed apps to get new features, better user experience, and to resolve potential issues you might have experienced with that app before. You can also update the overall software that's currently running on your phone. These second form of updates can be placed into two categories.

* **Security Patches**: These are small updates that fixes underlying security vulnerabilities of your smartphone. These updates usually don't add new features but they are still very important. For example, the December 2023 security patch for Android fixed 94 security vulnerabilities. [^1] Hackers are always trying to take advantage of these security issues to steal your personal information and so you should install these updates as soon as they are released.

* **Android Version Update**: This is the major yearly update that adds lot of new features to your smartphone and improves the overall user interface. Most companies still offer only 2 years of Android version updates, however brands like Samsung and Google has recently started offering 4 years of Android version updates since the phone's release.

We will now go over how to keep you apps and software up to date.

However, you can just use your phone for other task while the apps are updating in the background. Also, if you want to stop the update process at any point, you can just click 'Cancel All'.

That's all there is to it regarding updating apps on your phone. Let's now see how to update the overall software on your phone.

However, if an update is available, the phone will start downloading it. Once the download process has finished, it will give you option to schedule the installation or install it right now. Make sure your phone has enough charge before clicking 'Install Now'. We recommend having at least 50% charge before you start updating the phone.

Now, the phone will restart and take some time to update. Your phone might even restart multiple times during the update process. The progress bar during update will look like the image below.
