# Changing Ringtone

Hearing the same ringtone every time some calls can get boring over time. Smartphones now include many nice ringtones that you can switch to in just a couple of clicks.

First, go to the Settings menu by either clicking on the gear icon or scrolling down on your home screen and clicking on the top right hand corner.

The blue circle to the left will be on the last ringtone you played. Now if you go back to homepage (by clicking on the button circled in orange), your ringtone will not change! To change your ringtone, click on your favorite ringtone so far and then click the back button (circled in white).
