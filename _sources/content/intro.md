# Welcome to Smartphone Tutorials

This is a small project aimed to create detailed smartphone tutorials so that anyone follow along easily.

From our personal experience, many people still use smartphones for very basic purposes, like calling, texting, listening to music, and little bit of surfing the internet. But smartphones these days can do so much more.  We think knowing some of these features can make an improvement in the quality of life of so many people. However, the problem with most smartphone guides is they are very text-heavy and not easy to follow along. For instance, below is a snippet Samsung S22's user guide. For that reason, we are building this site to create detailed step-by-step tutorials along with screenshots/gifs that anyone can follow.

#### How can YOU contribute to this project?

Well, you can of course spread the word about our website. Also, let us know your thoughts about the website through one of the Google forms or just by commenting on this post. But you can do more…

Currently we have tutorials for Google Pixel, Samsung, Xiaomi, and iPhones. While that covers some of the popular brands, we cannot possibly cover all brands because we need all those phones and also we don’t have enough people to write all those tutorials. However, we are thinking about building a system where anyone can submit their tutorial, and after review, if we think it’s good enough, then we will add it to the site. If you know of any platform to make this process seamless, please let us know.

Also, multi-lingual support is another feature that we have in our mind. It’s complicated for two reasons. (1) We need a good translator and (2) we have to maintain parallel versions of the site. However, if you are willing to volunteer to translate the tutorials, we would be more than happy to find a way to streamline the process of maintaining parallel versions of the site.
