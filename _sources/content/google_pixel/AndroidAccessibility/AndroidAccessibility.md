## Accessibility on your Android Phone

Sometimes, your phone is difficult to read or use! Fortunately, Android phones have many features to help you. First, open up the settings app from your App Drawer.

#### Making text bigger

If you have trouble seeing text on your phone because it's too small, you can increase the font size. Tap on the Font size button and slide the slider until text looks big enough for you! You can click the back button to go back to the previous screen.

#### Making everything bigger

If everything on your phone looks too small, you can also change the Display size the same way! This will make everything bigger, not just the text.

#### Using a magnifying glass

Another useful way to make things look bigger is to use a virtual magnifying glass! Tap on Magnification, then turn it one by tapping Use service. The instructions on the screen should help you understand how to use this tool.

#### Changing white to black

If you find it hard to read on a white background, you can use the Dark theme to change it to black! Simply click on the Dark theme button. You can click again to switch it back. If you get a pop-up, click Got it and it will work normally.
